=head1 MOTIVATION

B<Why «dark magic»?> The script uses a technique which making use of, is higly disencouraged by intelligent programmers:
L<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41061214/write-to-the-data-section-in-perl>

B<Why the name «unding»?> C<unding> derives from the German I<Un-Ding>, meaning the negation of a thing, a I<Not-Thing> (nothing).
The negation can be meant pejoratively, relating to the I<dark magic> invoced.
But also descriptively, because the script transforms a I<thing> (text) into a I<nothing> (cypher text).

B<So what's in for me?> The I<dark magic> offers you your encrypted secret together with to code to decrypt it in one single file.
All you need to de- and encrypt is this file and a Perl environment.
No separation of ciphertext and cryptologic.
